<h1>Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for creating a model to predict the survival chance of a Titanic passenger. The notebook was originally created for the Kaggle competition available at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/submissions">https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/submissions</a>

The data is imported using the Kaggle API method, therefore, to reproduce the results you will need to have a Kaggle API file named <strong>kaggle.json</strong> in your Colab workspace.

The repository also includes the predictions made by the model.


<h1>Contents</h2>
<ol>
<li>TitanicSurvivalPrediction.ipynb: This is the Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for the Titanic survival prediction model.</li>
<li>predictions.csv: This file contains the predictions made by the model.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Requirements</h2>
To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the results, you will need:

<ol>
<li>Python 3.x</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>NumPy</li>
<li>Scikit-learn</li>
<li>A Kaggle API file named "kaggle.json" in your Colab workspace.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed above.</li>
<li> Place your Kaggle API file named "kaggle.json" in your Colab workspace.</li>
<li> Open the TitanicSurvivalPrediction.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook.</li>
<li> Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code and generate the predictions.</li>
<li> The output will be saved to a file named predictions.csv.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Credits</h2>
The original data set used for the Titanic survival prediction model was obtained from <a>https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.</a>

The code for the model was created by Ayesha Naime.
