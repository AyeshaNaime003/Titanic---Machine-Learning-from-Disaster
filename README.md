#Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster


##Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for creating a model to predict the survival chance of a Titanic passenger. The notebook was originally created for the Kaggle competition available at **https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/submissions.**

The data is imported using the Kaggle API method, therefore, to reproduce the results you will need to have a Kaggle API file named **"kaggle.json"** in your Colab workspace.

The repository also includes the predictions made by the model.


##Contents
TitanicSurvivalPrediction.ipynb: This is the Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for the Titanic survival prediction model.

predictions.csv: This file contains the predictions made by the model.

##Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the results, you will need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
A Kaggle API file named "kaggle.json" in your Colab workspace.


#Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed above.
2, Place your Kaggle API file named "kaggle.json" in your Colab workspace.
3. Open the TitanicSurvivalPrediction.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code and generate the predictions.
5. The output will be saved to a file named predictions.csv.


#Credits
The original data set used for the Titanic survival prediction model was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

The code for the model was created by Ayesha Naime.
